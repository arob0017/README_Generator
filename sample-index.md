  ## Description 
  In this project using node I have created a ReadMe template. This is to help quickly put a ReadMe together without needing to put in too much effort. <br>

  ### Installation 
  Clone this repo and open it on your computer. Once opening in your Visual Studio Code, open the intergrated terminal. Install node and then run 'npm start'. There will be a list of questions you will be asked about the readMe you will be creating. The generated Readme will then appear with the other files in the main folder. <br>
